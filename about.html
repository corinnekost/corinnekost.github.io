	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Howdy! I'm Corinne (aka Corndog). Born and raised in suburban Michigan, I've traveled some—but not enough.

Lately, I’ve been working to solidify my coding skills beyond the basics, which led me to build this website. I enjoy tinkering with Arduino circuits and IoT projects as part of my studies. I'm also focused on improving my enterprise IT and networking skills while working toward my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certification.

In my free time, I like to crochet, read, and experiment with baking. I also go through occasional spurts of following fitness routines.

My professional journey started at thirteen, spending summers laboring on a corn farm. After bouncing through a series of less-than-serious jobs, I pursued an Associate’s degree in Cybersecurity. However, I found online learning insufficient—I thrive on hands-on experience (and failure). To bridge the gap, I volunteered at a local enterprise and worked my way up from volunteer → extern → service desk analyst → technical support specialist I → technical support specialist II → and now my current role as a technical support specialist III.

I’m passionate about IT and love sharing knowledge with others. Feel free to [contact me] with any feedback about the site or just to say hi.

Party on.

I love working in IT because it’s like climbing an unscalable mountain—you’ll never reach the top, but isn’t it thrilling to see how far you can go?</p>
