	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Howdy. I'm Corinne (A.K.A. Corndog). Born and raised in suburban Michigan; I've traveled some, but not enough. Recently I've been working to solidify my coding skills beyond just the core basics, which is part of what lead to me building this website. I've been playing with Arduino circuits and IoT projects as part of my schoolwork. I want to improve my enterprise IT and networking skills, and am working to get my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate. In my personal time, I like to crochet, read, attempt to bake, with occasional spurts of following fitness routines. I started my professional occupational journey at the age of thirteen, spending my summers laboring on a corn farm, then flipping through mostly unserious jobs until I decided to begin my Associate's degree in Cybersecurity. After some time at that, I decided I was not learning enough as my schooling had been entirely online, and I require tactile learning (and failing) to thrive, so I volunteered for a local enterprise and worked my way up from a volunteer > extern > service desk analyst > technical support specialist i > technical support specialist ii > and finally my current role as a technical support specialist iii. I am passionate about what I do, and love sharing knowledge with others. Please Contact me with any feedback about the site, or just to say hi. Party on.</p>
	<p>I enjoy working in IT because it's like climbing an unscalable mountain; you'll never be done, but isn't it thrilling to see how far you can go?</p>
